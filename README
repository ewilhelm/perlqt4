This is not the code you're looking for.  Or maybe it is.

This repository is a radical fork from the PerlQt3 way of doing things,
with the goal of removing the this() method, global variables, odd
subclassing, AUTOLOAD()s, and segmentation faults.  The upstream qt4
project has (thus far) followed the architecture of Qt3.
